This code creates a simple age calculator that takes a birth date as input and calculates the age based on the current date.

Here's how it works:

1. The HTML file creates a basic form with a date input field and a button to calculate the age.
2. The CSS file styles the form and button to make it look more visually appealing.
3. The JavaScript file gets the birth date input field and button elements using document.getElementById.
4. It adds an event listener to the button to call the calculateAge function when clicked.
5. The calculateAge function gets the birth date value from the input field and creates a new Date object from it.
6. It calculates the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year, and then adjusts the age based on the month and day differences.
7. Finally, it updates the age result paragraph with the calculated age.
